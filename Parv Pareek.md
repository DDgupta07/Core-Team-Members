# About me
## Parv Pareek

Hi everyone, I am Parv and I'm a student at Marwadi University. I'm currently purusing B.Tech in CE and I'm really interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and web3. I'm eager to learn more about these technologies and how they can be used to make a positive impact on the world.

I'm also a very helpful person and I'm always willing to lend a hand. I'm also open to feedback and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills.

I'm looking forward to meeting all of you and learning from each other. Thank you for having me here today.
